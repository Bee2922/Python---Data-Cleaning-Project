Python-Data-Cleaning-Project
Before cleaning the dataset, the Olympics dataset contained 70,000 rows and 15 columns. After completing the cleaning process, it was reduced to 7,000 rows and 15 columns. To achieve this, I performed several steps: I removed duplicates, standardised the data, eliminated null values, dropped unnecessary columns, renamed one column, and reset the index due to the impact of the removed null values. Finally, I saved the cleaned data as a CSV file.
